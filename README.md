# GraphQL Client Example

This is an example React + Apollo app. My goal with is to demonstrate how we can test an app like this.

The dummy backend is available [here](https://github.com/nandito/graphql-server-example).

### The stack is the following:

* React with (Create React App)
* Apollo
* Jest + Enzyme for tests
* Ant.design

## Getting started

1. Clone this project
2. Go to the project directory and install dependencies: `yarn install`
3. Run the app: `yarn start`
